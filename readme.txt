During my studies, I designed a PCB with my colleagues.

A PCB was designed to identify the 802.3af protocol, voltage conversions enabling power supply for ESP32 (48V -> 3.3V)
and support for the temperature and humidity sensor (ENS210, SPI).

The board has several disadvantages:
- no mounting holes,
- unnecessary vias,
- wrong nano ESP32 socket spacing

In summary, the board work is correct.
